Team Member: Jaden
Tasks: Laser cutting acrylic slab for gears
Completion status: 80%
Outstanding issues and risks: Acrylic is much thinner than our printed gears so we will have to glue 2 gears together

Team Member: Dan
Tasks: Wii Board controller algorithm
Completion status: 70%
Outstanding issues and risks: Design choices are being debated about whether the board should act as a joystick or
a standerd "left, right, forward, back" controller. Need to finalize it.
