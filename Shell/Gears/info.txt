Some random information

Motor Gear: 2662N14 (Inner Diameter 0.106in)
Compound Gear: 2662N14 + 2662N15 (Inner Diameter 0.288in)
Each compound gear doubles the gear ratio
Currently using 5 gears for 16:1 ratio

Meshed gear center distance -> 0.57in (near perfect fit)
Brass rods -> 2mm
Axle -> 2mm

Gear Test Mount 1 -> 0.35in X 0.45 Y
Gear Test Mount 2 -> 0.9 Y
This is offset from the motor axle
Can do other designs, but must have some combination of
0.57in diagonals that meet at wheel axle while respecting collisions

Washers are 2mm thick

M2.5 screws need 0.2in space for head
