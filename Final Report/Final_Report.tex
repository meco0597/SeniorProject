%This is all taken from 2018 requirements of the report and will be updated as needed

\section{Introduction}
%Introduction and motivation (describe the problem, and who cares if you solve it)

\section{Background}
%Background (What other things are out there that you're drawing from? Are there similar things that you're referencing or extending?)

\section{Project Implementation}
%Project Implementation (The details of what you did, what you used, and why you made the choices you did. This is likely to be by far the largest section of your report, and can have multiple sub-sections) 

\section{Discoveries}
%Discoveries and pitfalls (things you learned and things that other groups would find helpful)

\section{Evaluation}
%How well did it work - be honest here - if there were things that didn't work out the way you expected, write about them too. Also make sure to describe your testing and evaluation strategy. Don't just say it worked - describe how you know it worked, and even what "worked" means. This is likely to be the second-largest section in your report.

\section{Bill of Materials}
% Bill of materials (or at least a list of all the materials, equipment, etc. that you used. You don't need prices here, but you should include a list of things you used)

\section{Conclusion}
%- Conclusions (wrap things up with some final text. Include a pointer to your final web site.)
